# Contact Form with Validation (Demo)

A simple, lightweight contact form demo with client-side validation—no backend integration. Perfect for front-end demos, templates, or learning exercises.

---

## Features

- Three **required fields**: Full Name, Email Address, and Message.
- Real-time **client-side validation** for form inputs.
- Upon valid submission, shows a **success message**:
  
  > "Message sent successfully! Thank you for reaching out. We'll get back to you soon."

- **No backend** or messaging logic—functionality is limited to the browser.

---

## Demo

Access the live demo here:  
https://sid16p.github.io/Contact-Form/

 Try entering invalid inputs (e.g. missing fields or improper email) to see validation in action.

---

## Usage

1. **Clone the repository** or download the project files.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser.
3. Fill out the form and click **"Send Message"**.
4. If all inputs pass validation, the success message is displayed.
5. Note: Form submissions are **not sent**—this is a front-end demo only.

## Customization Tips

- To add a backend, implement form handling using technologies like **Node.js**, **PHP**, **Python (Flask/Django)**, or integrate with a service like **Formspree** or **EmailJS**.
- Enhance validation using libraries like **jQuery Validation**, **Parsley.js**, or **Just-validate**.
- Style the form using your favorite CSS framework (e.g., **Bootstrap**, **Tailwind CSS**, **Material UI**) or custom styles.
- Improve accessibility by adding **ARIA labels**, clearer **error messages**, and **keyboard navigation**.
